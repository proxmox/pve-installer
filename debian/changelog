  * fine tune swap selection for low memory/space setups

  * lvm create: rework auto-space distribution and improve for low size
    setups. Avoid a per-default extra free space block if the disk has
    less than 32 GB of total space. Use the full rest size for root if
    it's below 12 GB, not much of a point in setting up a data thin LVM
    for guests then. Then also show a display message if no thin LVM is
    created to inform the admin.

    table)

  * use update-initramfs -c (instead of -u)

  * do not write /etc/apache2/ports.conf (not really needed)

  * enable apache port redirect (a2ensite pve-redirect.conf)
